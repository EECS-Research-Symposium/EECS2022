						Network slicing creates multiple logical networks and enables 5G to meet the diverse performance
						requirements of emerging services and applications. We model the RAN, edge, and core networks
						and study end-to-end network slicing in 5G. We consider the problem of admitting new slice requests
						as a constrained optimization problem that seeks to maximize the total reward to the network operator
						while considering the impact of slice redistributions in the network. We propose a multi-phase
						polynomial-time, greedy approach to solve this NP-hard problem. It employs two comprehensive
						weighted cost functions for request selection and resource allocation that take into account the
						slice-specific requirements and multi-dimensional resources at the RAN, edge, and core networks.
						We use a Bayesian optimization technique to automatically tune the cost functions as a function of
						the network topology, networking resources, resource arrival rate, and slice-specific requirements.
						Our extensive numerical results show that the proposed approach achieves a total reward that is
						competitive with the optimal solution and is higher than the benchmark schemes at realistic higher
						request arrival rates, while requiring fewer slice redistributions.

				Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is a 5G and beyond application expected to serve
				millions of internet-of-things devices within a small region. These devices transmit short packets
				and are sporadically active. We need to use grant-free random access (RA) protocols to serve such
				devices. In this work, we look at the coded slotted aloha (CSA) family of RA protocols in which
				users transmit several encoded replicas of their packets across different resource elements in a
				frame. We first leverage sparse signal recovery techniques to propose a user activity detection (UAD)
				algorithm to detect the subset of active users in a frame in CSA. We then perform data decoding and
				analyse the impact of UAD errors, i.e., false alarms and missed detections, on the performance of the
				system. This analysis accounts for practical non-idealities such as UAD errors, channel estimation
				errors, and pilot contamination. Finally, we provide several insights into the performance of RA for
				mMTC: Which UAD error is more harmful? What limits the performance of the system? How do
				we overcome these limits?

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electrical Communication Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				A Metasurface facilitates exciting surface properties by engineering geometric profiles and find
				several applications in microwaves and optics. Its surface impedance can be controlled to tailor the
				amplitude and phase of the impinging waves. Often in a periodic structure, its operation depends on
				the periodicity and resonant characteristics of the underlying unit cell geometry. These surfaces are
				used as a microwave reflector, absorber, or phase shifter and are employed in antennas to miniaturize
				the geometry, reconfigure its radiation properties, or generate multiple main lobes.
				In the first part of this work a digitally reconfigurable metasurface is designed, where the transmission
				through the unit cell is switched ON or OFF, thereby modifying the overall radiation pattern of an
				antenna placed behind this planar array. The metasurface is designed with a unit cell consisting
				of a meandered line and a PIN diode. Our experimental studies illustrated for the first time that
				the presence of scatterers enhances the performance of media based modulation (MBM) using this
				scheme, and is expected to provide impetus to build practical communication systems using this
				approach<br>
				In the second part of this work, a wideband metasurface consisting of multiple metallic patches
				with surface mounted lumped resistors to absorb the EM waves over 1-6 GHz is designed. This
				metasurface is used with a compact spiral antenna to improve its low-frequency responses . A
				conventional spiral antenna is a wideband circularly polarized bidirectional radiator used for
				wideband communication, radar jamming and electronic warfare. When placed inside a compact
				metallic cavity to mount it on a ship or aircraft, its low-frequency radiation performances are affected.
				It has been shown that the use of metasurface improves the antenna responses thereby making
				it suitable for use over a frequency band of 1-18 GHz. Numerical optimization is carried out to
				design the metasurface geometry as well as to optimize the spiral antenna performance. A prototype
				antenna with the metasurface is fabricated and characterized inside an anechoic chamber to validate
				its performance.

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electrical Communication Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become very popular for processing and analyzing graph-structured
				data in the last few years. GNN architectures learn low-dimensional graph-level or node-level
				embeddings useful for several downstream machine learning tasks by using message passing as their
				basic building block that aggregates information from neighborhoods. Existing GNN architectures
				can be categorized based on how they perform this aggregation task: 1) GNNs that learn the node
				embeddings by iteratively combining information from its neighborhood by cascading several GNN
				blocks. We refer to such GNN architectures with sequential aggregation as SA-GNNs and 2) GNN
				architectures that precompute the node features from different neighborhood depths using a bank of
				neighborhood aggregation graph operators simultaneously. We refer to such GNN architectures with
				parallel aggregation as PA-GNNs. Due to the precomputations, PA-GNNs have a natural advantage
				of reduced training and inference time.
				We provide theoretical conditions under which a generic PA-GNN model is provably as powerful
				as the popular Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test in discriminating non-isomorphic
				graphs. Although PA-GNNs do not have an apparent relationship with the WL test, we show that
				the graph embeddings obtained from these two methods are injectively related. We then propose a
				specialized PA-GNN model, which obeys the developed conditions. We demonstrate via numerical
				experiments on several graph classification benchmark datasets that the developed model achieves
				state-of-the-art performance on many diverse real-world datasets while maintaining the discriminative
				power of the WL test and the computational advantage of preprocessing graphs before the training
				process.

			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Fast Algorithms for Max Cut on Geometric Intersection Graphs In the max cut problem, given a
				graph, the goal is to partition the vertex set into two disjoint sets such that the number of edges
				having their endpoints in different sets is maximized. Max cut is an NP-hard problem. The seminal
				work by Goemans and Williamson gave an approximation algorithm for the max cut problem having
				an approximation ratio of 0.878.
				In this work, we design fast algorithms for max cut on geometric intersection graphs. In a
				geometric intersection graph, given a collection of n geometric objects as the input, each object
				corresponds to a vertex and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding
				objects intersect. Since we are dealing with the geometric intersection graphs, which have more
				structure than general graphs, the following questions are of interest: Are there special cases of
				geometric intersection graphs for which max cut can be solved exactly in polynomial time? It can be
				shown that the random cut gives a 0.5 approximation for the max cut. Is it possible to design linear
				or near-linear time algorithms (in terms of n) and beat the 0.5 approximation barrier? The edge-set
				of the graph is not explicitly given as input; therefore, designing linear time algorithms is of interest.
				Can an approximation factor better than 0.878 be obtained for the geometric intersection graphs?
				An exact and fast algorithm for laminar geometric intersection graphs. Our algorithm uses a
				greedy strategy. A fast algorithm is obtained by combining the properties of laminar objects with
				range searching data structures. An O(n log n) time algorithm with an approximation factor of 2/3 for
				unit interval intersection graphs. We decompose the unit intervals into several cliques, and based on
				the number of edges between "adjacent" cliques, we choose an appropriate partitioning strategy. An
				O(n log n) time algorithm with an approximation factor of 7/13 for unit square intersection graphs.
				We use the "largest clique" in the graph to beat the 0.5 approximation barrier

			<div class="abs_title">  Equivalence Test for Read-Once Arithmetic Formulas   </div>
			<div class="abs_authors"> Nikhil Gupta</div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computer Science and Automation </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				A read-once arithmetic formula (ROF) C over a field F is a tree, where a leaf node is labelled by
				either a distinct variable or a constant from F and a non-leaf node is labelled by either + or ×. Every
				node of C computes a polynomial naturally - a leaf node computes its label and a + node (or a ×
				node) computes the sum (respectively, the product) of the polynomials computed by its children.
				The equivalence testing problem for ROFs is as follows: given black-box access to a polynomial
				f ∈ F[x1,..., xn] of degree at most n, decide if there exists an ROF C, an invertible matrix A ∈ F
				n×n and a vector b ∈ Fn, such that f = C(Ax + b), where x = (x1x2 ··· xn)T. Further, if the answer is
				yes then output an ROF C, an invertible matrix A and a vector b, such that f = C(Ax+b). In this
				work, we give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm (with oracle access to the quadratic form
				equivalence test over F) for the equivalence testing problem for ROFs.
				At the heart of this algorithm lies a detailed analysis of the essential variables of the Hessian
				determinant of an ROF. This analysis becomes technically challenging due to the arbitrary structure
				of the underlying tree of an ROF. We overcome this challenge and use the knowledge of the essential
				variables to design an efficient randomized equivalence test for ROFs.

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computer Science and Automation </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				We consider minimisation of dynamic regret in non-stationary bandits with a slowly varying property.
				Namely, we assume that arms’ rewards are stochastic and independent over time, but that the absolute
				difference between the expected rewards of any arm at any two consecutive time-steps is at most
				a drift limit δ > 0. For this setting that has not received enough attention in the past, we give a
				new algorithm which extends naturally the well-known Successive Elimination algorithm to the
				non-stationary bandit setting. We establish the first instance-dependent regret upper bound for slowly
				varying non-stationary bandits. The analysis in turn relies on a novel characterization of the instance
				as a detectable gap profile that depends on the expected arm reward differences. We also provide
				the first minimax regret lower bound for this problem, enabling us to show that our algorithm is
				essentially minimax optimal. Also, this lower bound we obtain matches that of the more general
				total variation-budgeted bandits problem, establishing that the seemingly easier former problem
				is at least as hard as the more general latter problem in the minimax sense. We complement our

			<div class="abs_title">  Tight Approximation Algorithms for Two-dimensional Guillotine Strip Packing   </div>
			<div class="abs_authors"> Aditya Lonkar </div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computer Science and Automation </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				In the STRIP PACKING problem (SP), we are given a vertical half-strip [0,W]×[0,∞) and a set of
				n axis-aligned rectangles of width at most W. The goal is to find a non-overlapping packing of
				all rectangles into the strip such that the height of the packing is minimized. A well-studied and
				frequently used practical constraint is to allow only those packings that are guillotine separable, i.e.,
				every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by recursively applying a sequence of edge-to-edge
				axis-parallel cuts (guillotine cuts) that do not intersect any item of the solution. In this paper, we
				study approximation algorithms for the GUILLOTINE STRIP PACKING problem (GSP), i.e., the
				STRIP PACKING problem where we require additionally that the packing needs to be guillotine
				separable. This problem generalizes the classical BIN PACKING problem and also makespan
				minimization on identical machines, and thus it is already strongly NP-hard. Moreover, due
				to a reduction from the PARTITION problem, it is NP-hard to obtain a polynomial-time (3/2 −
				ε)-approximation algorithm for GSP for any ε > 0 (exactly as STRIP PACKING). We provide a
				matching polynomial time (3/2+ε)-approximation algorithm for GSP. Furthermore, we present a
				pseudo-polynomial time (1+ε)-approximation algorithm for GSP. This is surprising as it is NP-hard
				to obtain a (5/4−ε)-approximation algorithm for (general) STRIP PACKING in pseudo-polynomial
				time. Thus, our results essentially settle the approximability of GSP for both the polynomial and the

			<div class="abs_authors"> Arindam Khan, Aditya Subramanian and Andreas Wiese</div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computer Science and Automation </div>

				We study rectangle stabbing problems in which we are given n axis-aligned rectangles in the plane
				that we want to stab, i.e., we want to select line segments such that for each given rectangle there is
				a line segment that intersects two opposite edges of it. In the horizontal rectangle stabbing problem
				(STABBING), the goal is to find a set of horizontal line segments of minimum total length such that
				all rectangles are stabbed. In general rectangle stabbing problem, also known as horizontal-vertical
				stabbing problem (HV-STABBING), the goal is to find a set of rectilinear (i.e., either vertical or
				horizontal) line segments of minimum total length such that all rectangles are stabbed. Both variants
				are NP-hard. Chan, van Dijk, Fleszar, Spoerhase, and Wolff initiated the study of these problems by
				providing constant approximation algorithms. Recently, Eisenbrand, Gallato, Svensson, and Venzin
				have presented a QPTAS and a polynomial-time 8-approximation algorithm for STABBING but it
				was open whether the problem admits a PTAS.
				In this work, we obtain a PTAS for STABBING, settling this question. For HV-STABBING, we

			<div class="abs_title">   Algorithmic Problems on Vertex Deletion and Graph Coloring   </div>

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computer Science and Automation </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Vertex deletion problems form a core topic in algorithmic graph theory with many applications.
				Typically, the objective of a vertex deletion problem is to delete the minimum number of vertices
				so that the remaining graph satisfies some property. Many classic optimization problems like
				MAXIMUM CLIQUE, MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, VERTEX COVER are examples of vertex
				deletion problems. We study popular vertex deletion problems called CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION
				and its generalisation s-CLUB CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION, both being important in the context
				of graph-based data clustering. A cluster is often viewed as a dense subgraph (often a clique) and
				partitioning a graph into such clusters is one of the main objectives of graph-based data clustering.
				However, to account for the errors introduced during the construction of the network, the clusters of
				certain networks may be retrieved by making a small number of modifications such as deleting some
				vertices.
				Given a graph G, the objective of CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION (CVD) is to delete a
				minimum number of vertices so that the remaining graph is a set of disjoint cliques. We focus
				on polynomial-time solvability of CVD on special classes of graphs. Chordal graphs (graphs
				with no induced cycle of length greater than 3) are well studied class of graphs having many
				applications in algorithmic graph theory. Though polynomial-time algorithms for certain sub classes
				of chordal graphs such as interval graphs, block graphs and split graphs are known, the computational
				complexity of CVD on chordal graphs remains unknown. We study CVD on well-partitioned chordal
				graphs, another sub class of chordal graphs that generalizes split graphs, which is introduced as a
				tool for narrowing down complexity gaps for problems that are hard on chordal graphs, and easy on
				split graphs
				In many applications the equivalence of cluster and clique is too restrictive. For example, in
				protein networks where proteins are the vertices and the edges indicate the interaction between the
				proteins, a more appropriate notion of clusters may have a diameter of more than 1. Therefore
				researchers have defined the notion of s-clubs. An s-club is a graph with diameter at most s. The
				objective of s-CLUB CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION (s-CVD) is to delete the minimum number of
				vertices from the input graph so that all connected components of the resultant graph is an s-club.
				We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for (s-CVD) on trapezoid graphs, a class of intersection
				graphs. To the best of our knowledge, our result provides the first polynomial-time algorithm for
				CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION on trapezoid graphs. We also provide a faster algorithm for s-CVD
				on interval graphs. For each s ≥ 1, we give an O(n(n+m))-time algorithm for s-CVD on interval
				graphs with n vertices and m edges. We also prove some hardness results for s-CVD on planar
				bipartite graphs, split graphs and well-partitioned chordal graphs for each s ≥ 2.
				Graph coloring has diverse applications and is still a prominent research area to tackle many
				practical problems by simulating them as coloring the vertices or edges of a graph subject to
				some constraints. Efficient and scalable implementation of parallel algorithms on multiprocessor
				architectures with multiple memory banks require simultaneous access to the data items. Such
				“conflict-free” access to parallel memory systems and other applied problems motivate the study
				of rainbow coloring of a graph, in which there is a fixed template T (or a family of templates),
				and one seeks to color the vertices of an input graph G with as few colors as possible, so that each
				copy of T in G is rainbow colored, i.e., has no two vertices the same color. We call such coloring a
				template-driven rainbow coloring and study the rainbow coloring of proper interval graphs (as hosts)
				for cycle templates

				Autonomous marine vehicles play an essential role in many ocean science and engineering applications.
				Planning time and energy optimal paths for these vehicles to navigate in stochastic dynamic ocean
				environments is essential to reduce operational costs. In some missions, they must also harvest
				solar, wind, or wave energy (modeled as a stochastic scalar field) and move in optimal paths that
				minimize net energy consumption. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework
				for sequential decision making for robotic agents in such environments. However, building a realistic
				model and solving the modeledMDP becomes computationally expensive in large-scale real-time
				applications, warranting the need of parallel algorithms and efficient implementation. In the present
				work, we introduce an efficient end-to-end GPU-accelerated algorithm that (i) builds the MDP
				model (computing transition probabilities and expected one-step rewards); and (ii) solves the MDP
				to compute an optimal policy. We develop methodical and algorithmic solutions to overcome the
				limited global memory of GPUs by (i) using a dynamic reduced-order representation of the ocean
				flows, (ii) leveraging the sparse nature of the state transition probability matrix, (iii) introducing a
				neighbouring sub-grid concept and (iv) proving that it is sufficient to use only the stochastic scalar
				field’s mean to compute the expected one-step rewards for missions involving energy harvesting from
				the environment; thereby saving memory and reducing the computational effort. We demonstrate the
				algorithm on a simulated stochastic dynamic environment and highlight that it builds the MDP model
				and computes the optimal policy 600-1000x faster than conventional CPU implementations, making
				it suitable for real-time use. We also demonstrate applications of our planner for multi-objective
				optimization problems, where trade-offs between multiple conflicting objectives are achieved (such
				as minimizing expected mission time, energy consumption, and environmental energy harvesting)

				The past few years have seen a surge of work on fairness in allocation problems where items must be
				fairly divided among agents having individual preferences. In comparison, fairness in settings with
				preferences on both sides, that is, where agents have to be matched to other agents, has received much
				less attention. Moreover, two-sided matching literature has largely focused on ordinal preferences.
				This paper initiates the study of fairness in stable many-to-one matchings under cardinal valuations.
				We study leximin optimality over stable many-to-one matchings. We first investigate matching
				problems with ranked valuations where all agents on each side have the same preference orders
				or rankings over the agents on the other side (but not necessarily the same valuations). Here, we
				provide a complete characterisation of the space of stable matchings. This leads to FaSt, a novel and
				efficient algorithm to compute a leximin optimal stable matching under ranked isometric valuations
				(where, for each pair of agents, the valuation of one agent for the other is the same). Building upon
				FaSt, we present an efficient algorithm, FaSt-Gen, that finds the leximin optimal stable matching for
				a more general ranked setting. We next establish that, in the absence of rankings and under strict
				preferences, finding a leximin optimal stable matching is NP-Hard. Further, with weak rankings,
				the problem is strongly NP-Hard, even under isometric valuations. In fact, when additivity and

				Deep models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Such attacks are carefully crafted
				imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause severe consequences when deployed. To

				We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of adversarial samples. Our adversarial
				sample detection framework is initially trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the

				on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and obtaining their low

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Computational and Data Sciences </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Localizing objects in a scene has been a long-sought pursuit in computer vision literature. More
				recent works focus on localizing objects in the image using text and image queries. However, there
				are many different kinds of unexplored modalities in the literature. In this work, we rigorously
				study the problem of localizing objects in the image using queries such as sketches, gloss, and scene
				graphs.
				Sketch query: We introduce the novel problem of localizing all the instances of an object (seen
				or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. The sketch-guided object localization
				proves to be more challenging when we consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are
				abstract representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of the object, (ii)
				the sketches have significant variability as they are hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human
				subjects, and (iii) there exists a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as
				these are sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of sketch-guided
				object localization, we propose a novel cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal
				network (RPN) to generate object proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are
				later scored against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as little as a
				single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object categories not seen during training
				(one-shot localization) and is effective in localizing multiple object instances present in the image
				Sketch and gloss queries: Hand-drawn sketches are suitable as a query when neither an image
				nor the object class is available. However, hand-drawn crude sketches alone might be ambiguous
				for object localization when used as queries. On the other hand, a linguistic definition of the object
				category and the sketch query give better visual and semantic cues for object localization. This work
				presents a multimodal query-guided object localization approach under the challenging open-set
				setting. In particular, we use queries from two modalities, namely, hand-drawn sketch and description
				of the object (also known as gloss), to perform object localization. Multimodal query-guided object
				localization is a challenging task, especially when the large domain gap exists between the queries
				and the natural images and the challenge in optimally combining the complementary and minimal
				information present across the queries. To address the aforementioned challenges, we present a novel
				cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal network to generate object proposals
				relevant to the input queries and a novel orthogonal projection-based proposal scoring technique that
				scores each proposal with respect to the queries, thereby yielding the final localization results.
				Scene graph query: We present a framework for jointly grounding objects that follow certain
				semantic relationship constraints given in a scene graph. A typical natural scene contains several
				objects, often exhibiting visual relationships of varied complexities between them. These inter-object
				relationships provide strong contextual cues to improve grounding performance compared to a
				traditional object query-based localization task. A scene graph is an efficient and structured way to
				represent all the objects in the image and their semantic relationships. In an attempt to bridge these
				two modalities representing scenes and utilize contextual information to improve object localization,

				Learning modality invariant features is central to the problem of Visible-Thermal cross-modal
				Person Reidentification (VT-ReID), where query and gallery images come from different modalities.
				Existing works implicitly align the modalities in pixel and feature spaces by either using adversarial

				propose a simple but effective framework, MMD-ReID, that reduces the modality gap by an explicit
				discrepancy reduction constraint. MMD-ReID takes inspiration from Maximum Mean Discrepancy
				(MMD), a widely used statistical tool for hypothesis testing that determines the distance between two

				distributions of visible and thermal samples to minimize intra-class distances while maintaining
				feature discriminability. MMD-ReID is a simple framework in terms of architecture and loss
				formulation. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively
				the effectiveness of MMD-ReID in aligning the marginal and class conditional distributions, thus

				approach: first, we train a network using the BYOLobjective which operates at an instance level.
				The correspondences obtained through this network are further used to train a dense and compact

			<div class="abs_authors">Lakshmi Annamalai </div>
			<div class="abs_dept">  Department of Electonic Systems Engineering</div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Event-based cameras, also known as silicon retinas, are a novel type of biologically inspired sensors that encode per-pixel scene dynamics asynchronously with microsecond resolution in the form of a stream of events. Key advantages of an event camera are: high temporal resolution, sparse data, high dynamic range, and low power requirements, which makes it a suitable choice for resource-constrained environments. However, one of the most challenging aspects of working with event cameras is the continuous and asynchronous nature of the data. This has prompted a paradigm shift that allows efficient extraction of meaningful information from the space-time event data.
				Inspired by the benchmark set by the traditional vision and deep learning approaches, one of the predominant areas of research in event data focuses on aggregating the information conveyed by individual events onto a spatial grid representation. This ensures its compatibility with the tools available from the conventional vision domain. While interest in converting events into spatial representation by hand-crafted data transformations is growing, only very few approaches have looked into the more complex solutions that data-driven deep learning methods can provide. However, not every application has enough volume of labelled data to quench the data-hunger thirst of supervised deep learning algorithms, limiting the design of deep supervised networks to approximate complex functions. Hence, we have formulated the problem at hand as an unsupervised transformation to mitigate the challenges faced by supervised approaches due to limited availability of labelled data in the event domain.
				The proposed Event-LSTM is a generic, deep learning-based task-independent architecture for transforming raw events into spatial grid representation. We achieve task independence by operating the popular architecture, LSTM, in an unsupervised setting to learn a mapping from raw events into a task-unaware spatial representation, which we call LSTM Time Surface (LSTM-TS). The Event-LSTM puts forth unsupervised event data representation generation as an alternative to data-hungry supervised learning approaches. It eliminates the need for large quantities of labelled data for each task at hand.
				To take advantage of the asynchronous sensing principle of event cameras, Event-LSTM adapts asynchronous sampling of 2D spatial grid. The asynchronous 2D spatial grid sampling approach enables speed invariant feature extraction to cope with intraclass motion variations. It also initiates processing only when a specified number of events is accumulated, resulting in non-redundant energy-efficient feature extraction.

				Plug-and-play (PnP) is a relatively recent regularization technique for image reconstruction problems. As opposed to traditional methods that involve choosing a suitable regularizer function, PnP uses a high-quality denoiser such as nonlocal means (NLM) or BM3D within a proximal algorithm (e.g. ISTA or ADMM) to implicitly perform regularization. PnP has become popular in the imaging community; however, its regularization capacity is not fully understood yet. For example, it is not known if PnP can in theory recover a signal from few measurements, as in classical compressed sensing, and if the recovery is robust to noise. In this talk, we explore these questions and present some novel theoretical and experimental results.

				Some works based on approximation of l0 norm have shown superior performance. These methods have led to significant improvement in reconstruction image quality restoration.

				Cognitive decline is common in the aging population. However, chronological age may not
				necessarily be an accurate marker of brain health. Recently, several studies have employed
				neuroimaging based techniques to accurately determine brain health, also known as “brain age".
				Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE) seeks to accurately estimate the difference between chronological
				age and brain age, with the aim of establishing trajectories of healthy aging. Accurate estimation
				of the brain-age gap can aid in timely identification of markers of brain-related disorders. Here,
				using structural (T1-weighted) magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), we
				seek to identify anatomical and connectivity-based markers of brain age, in a large cohort of healthy
				participants from the TATA Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TLSA). We analyzed 23 standardized
				cognitive test scores using factor analysis and observed that the variation across all scores could be
				explained by two latent factors alone. Next, we used the T1-weighted images of each participant to
				extract structural features using a pre-trained simple fully convolutional neural network (SFCN). We
				then used these features to predict the brain age for each participant using a leave-k-participant-out
				approach. Predicted brain age correlated significantly with chronological age (r = 0.76, p < 0.001)
				with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.98 years. In parallel, we asked if anatomical connectivity
				could also predict brain age. For this, we estimated the structural brain connectome for each
				participant, and quantified brain-wide anatomical connectivity. We then used these connectivity
				features in a multiple linear regression model with recursive feature elimination. Our regression
				model robustly predicted brain age (r = 0.64, p < 0.001; MAE=5.00 years). We further pruned the
				structural connectomes using state-of-the-art pruning algorithms, ReAl-LiFE and SIFT2, to obtain
				more robust connectivity estimates. Here again, we observed similar results (ReAl-LiFE: r = 0.5,
				p < 0.001, MAE=5.6 years; SIFT2: r = 0.57, p < 0.001, MAE=5.26 years). After pruning, the brain
				regions critical for these age predictions involved the frontal cortex (posterior cingulate gyrus) and
				the occipital cortex (lingual gyrus). We then combined the structural and the connectivity features to
				predict age. Predicted brain age strongly correlated with chronological age (r = 0.76, p < 0.001;
				MAE=3.94 years), perhaps largely driven by the structural features themselves. Finally, we asked
				if the brain-age gap (δ) was indicative of participants’ cognitive performance. Indeed, brain-age
				gap correlated significantly with both latent factors 1 and 2 (Factor 1: r = 0.19, p < 0.05; Factor 2:
				r = 0.220, p < 0.005, controlling for age). dMRI-based connectivity and structural brain features
				may thus serve as reliable markers of age-related cognitive decline in healthy individuals as well as

				like Proper orthogonal decomposition(POD) or Karhunen-Loeve decomposition. The second part of
				our work focuses on preserving the diffusion equation based on the Laplacian matrix on the graph
				using a second-order conic programming(SOCP) formulation.
				Graph sparsification is an area of interest in mathematics and computer science. At first, we start
				by casting the problem of sparsification of the complex network as a data assimilation problem by
				considering the snapshot reaction-diffusion observations in a reduced subspace with a reduced order
				model dynamics modelled on the graph using the principles of POD. We incorporate connectivity

				Two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized the field of materials science since the successful
				exfoliation of graphene in 2004. Consequently, the advances in computational science have resulted in
				massive generic databases for 2D materials, where the structure and the basic properties are predicted
				using density functional theory (DFT). However, discovering material for a given application
				from these vast databases is a challenging feat. As part of my PhD, we have developed various
				automated high-throughput computational pipelines combining DFT and machine learning (ML) to
				assess the suitability of 2D materials for specific applications. Methods have also been developed
				to draw valuable insights into what makes these materials suitable for these applications. The
				assessed properties include suitability for energy storage in the form of Li-ion battery (LIB) and
				supercapacitor electrodes, along with high-temperature ferromagnetism and the presence of exotic
				charge density waves (CDW). The ultra-large surface-to-mass ratio of 2D materials has made them
				an ideal choice for electrodes of compact LIBs and supercapacitors. We combine explicit-ion and
				implicit-solvent formalisms to develop the high-throughput pipeline and define four descriptors
				to map âCœcomputationally softâC. single-Li-ion adsorption to âCœcomputationally hardâC.
				multiple-Li-ion-adsorbed configuration located at global minima for insight finding and rapid
				screening. Leveraging this large dataset, we also develop crystal-graph-based ML models for the
				accelerated discovery of potential candidates. A reactivity test with commercial electrolytes is
				further performed for wet experiments. Our unique approach, which predicts both Li-ion storage
				and supercapacitive properties and hence identifies various important electrode materials common to
				both devices, may pave the way for next-generation energy storage systems. The discovery of 2D
				ferromagnets with high Curie temperature is challenging since its calculation involves a manually
				intensive complex process. We develop a Metropolis Monte-Carlo based pipeline and conduct a
				high-throughput scan of 786 materials from a database to discover 26 materials with a Curie point
				beyond 400âC‰K. For rapid data mining; we further use these results to develop an end-to-end ML
				model with generalized chemical features through an exhaustive search of the model space as well
				as the hyperparameters. We discover a few more high Curie point materials from different sources
				using this data-driven model. CDW materials are an important subclass of two-dimensional materials
				exhibiting significant resistivity switching with the application of external energy. We combine a
				first-principles-based structure-searching technique and unsupervised machine learning to develop
				a high-throughput pipeline, which identifies CDW phases from a unit cell with an inherited Kohn
				anomaly. The proposed methodology not only rediscovers the known CDW phases but also predicts
				a host of easily exfoliable CDW materials (30 materials and 114 phases) along with associated

			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Due to the ability to provide high-order accurate solutions in complex geometries, the discontinuous-Galerkin
				(DG) method has received broad interest in developing partial differential equation (PDE) solvers,
				particularly for equations with hyperbolic nature. In addition, the method also provides high
				arithmetic intensity and, in an explicit formulation, avoids global linear solves, making it suitable
				for high-performance computing platforms. However, massively parallel simulations based on the
				DG method show poor scalability of solvers. This is mainly attributed to data communication and
				synchronization between different processing elements (PEs). Recently, an asynchronous computing
				approach was proposed based on finite differences that relax communication/synchronization
				at a mathematical level. In this approach, computations at PEs can proceed regardless of the
				communication status between the PEs, thus improving the scalability of PDE solvers. In this work,
				we extend the asynchronous computing approach to the DG method for improving its scalability
				at extreme scales. We investigate the numerical properties of standard DG schemes under relaxed
				communication synchronization and show that their accuracy drops to first order. Subsequently, we
				develop new asynchrony-tolerant fluxes that result in solutions of any arbitrary order of accuracy.
				Results from simulations of one-dimensional linear and nonlinear equations will be presented to

				Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as an excellent platform for building ultra-thin
				nonlinear photonics devices due to their high refractive index and strong nonlinear response. These
				materials are known to have layer dependent, electrically tunable optical properties with relaxed
				lattice and thermal mismatch requirement. 2D materials can also be used in various applications,
				such as wavelength converter, saturable absorber, optical modulator, and parametric down-converter.
				Firstly, we characterized the nonlinear properties of multi-layered Tin Diselenide (SnSe2). We
				investigated up-conversion of 1550 nm incident light using third-harmonic generation (THG) in
				multi-layered SnSe2, with the help of a multiphoton nonlinear microscopy setup. We have also
				studied its thickness dependence by simultaneously acquiring spatially resolved images in the forward
				and backward propagation direction. Next, we demonstrated strong second-harmonic generation
				(SHG) from a 2H polytype of multilayer Tin Diselenide. In the absence of excitonic resonance, the
				strong SHG from SnSe2 is attributed to the dominant band to band transition close to the indirect
				band edge. The SHG intensity was compared with a monolayer Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)
				and is found to be ≈ 34 and 3.4 times higher, for excitation wavelengths of 1040 nm and 1550
				nm, respectively. This work highlights the applicability of multi-layered 2D materials for building
				photonic devices despite having no excitonic resonance.
				Next, to make use of the strong nonlinear response, we numerically and experimentally demonstrated
				an optimized multilayer fabry-perot based dual-resonance structure to simultaneously enhance the

			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is seen as a promising high bandwidth access technology
				for emerging heterogeneous wireless networks for meeting the increasing data bandwidth requirements
				from mobile personal devices. Stand-alone VLC links making use of white or multicolor light-emitting
				diodes (LED), blue laser down-converted white light, and multicolor lasers as transmitters have
				been used to demonstrated multigigabit communication performance. In our lab we work on optical
				system design, such as VLC transmitter to serve both illumination and communication, path-loss
				optimization for variable link length, mechanical and non-mechanical beam steering, and mobile
				receiver tracking system for the indoor giga-bit class VLC system.
				Path-Loss Optimization: We discuss an optical ray-tracing approach for minimizing path-loss in a
				variable link length indoor blue laser down-converted white light visible light communication
				(VLC) system. For a given link length, minimum path-loss is achieved by finding optimum
				positions of transmitter and receiver lenses relative to phosphor and detector respectively such that
				collection efficiency is maximized. The designed VLC system is experimentally implemented for two
				different optimized link lengths of 25 and 300 cm. The illumination beam profile and propagation
				characteristics are found to be in good agreement with optical simulations. Communication
				experiments with on-off modulation at 1.5 Gbps achieved BER of 3 × 10-3 for the optimized
				link, which is below the forward-error correction threshold.
				Closed-Loop Non-Mechanical Beam Steering System: In this experiment, we demonstrate a
				hybrid Laser-LED transmitter module for indoor optical wireless communication with closed-loop,
				non-mechanical beam steering capability. The hybrid transmitter module consists of a near infrared
				laser diode for data communication and white LED array for illumination, combined on a diffuser
				surface. Dual-axis non-mechanical beam steering of the laser beam is implemented using two
				off-centered liquid lenses. The diffused laser beam directed towards the receiver is steered over an
				angular range of -7.6◦to 7.6◦(-1.7◦to 2.6◦) along the horizontal (vertical) axes spanning -200 to
				200 mm (-44 to 67 mm) at the receiver placed 1.5-meter from the transmitter. M-QAM/OFDM in
				combination with adaptive bit-and power-loading is utilized to achieve a total data throughput of
				5.15 Gbps for the diffused laser beam with steering. Laser intensity levels as measured at the receiver
				plane are kept below the maximum permissible exposure limit for indoor usage across the entire
				beam steering range. Closed-loop beam steering is also demonstrated by scanning the transmitted
				laser beam horizontally, measuring the signal strength using a low bandwidth photodetector and
				locking the laser beam to the receiver position for data-communication. Such hybrid transmitters
				offer the benefit of decoupling the data communication and illumination requirements of the indoor
				optical link, thereby tailoring the individual light emitter’s performance to specific use-case.

				Single-phase voltage source converters (VSC) find wide applications as an inverter, which integrates
				renewable sources, e.g., solar PV, fuel cell or battery storage system, into the grid. Also, different
				variable frequency drives, e.g., traction drives in electric locomotives, use single-phase VSC as the

				side power in single-phase VSCs. The difference power is oscillatory, with a frequency twice the ac
				side frequency. This oscillatory power affects the health and lifespan of dc sources adversely and
				causes torque oscillations in drives applications. To prevent this, various passive, active and hybrid
				filtering techniques are adopted to handle the difference power. Passive filter, consisting only of
				capacitor, necessitates large capacitor bank to keep double frequency voltage ripple across dc source
				within the limits. As traditionally used electrolytic capacitors have reliability concerns, the use of
				more reliable plastic film capacitors appears to be reasonable in applications, demanding greater
				availability. However, the large capacitance requirement often makes the filter size impracticable to
				be realized with film capacitors. The use of passive tuned LC filter reduces capacitance requirement,
				but can become ineffective if it gets detuned due to variation in filter parameters or grid frequency.
				As a result, the voltage across the dc source can exhibit a significant double frequency ripple. Active

				comparable to those of the main VSCs. Also, the main VSC functions satisfactorily as long as
				the added switches are functional. The above concerns are addressed by the proposed hybrid filter

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electrical Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Travelling Wave Tubes are amplifiers capable of operating over multiple octave bandwidths, finding
				applications in civilian communication, weather radars, air traffic control, etc., and for military
				requirements like search radars, electronic warfare, missile guidance and tracking, etc. On account
				of metal to ceramic joints with high voltage presence across them inside the tube’s vacuum envelop,
				there exists a partial or severe arcing possibility during the operation of the TWT. Therefore, the
				high voltage power supply powering the TWT is designed to withstand and limit the energy that
				may be discharged through the tube under expected operating conditions to prevent temporary or
				permanent damages arising out of high voltage arcing. This presentation describes the development
				of a compact power supply for a TWT demanding high voltage DC power of the order of 500W @
				4.3kV for the operation. Development of compact high voltage planar transformer, techniques to
				contain the EMI through the physical layout of the power converter switches, soft-switching, power
				line decoupling, selection of rectifiers for low loss and ripple, etc., are briefly touched upon in the
				presentation. The presentation also touches upon the challenges in using the latest GaN MOSFETs
				in high frequency-switched power converters from the output voltage ripple and EMI generation
				perspectives.

			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electrical Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				This talk introduces a systematic methodology to develop a unified model for a multi-port Triple
				Active Bridge (TAB) converter. The proposed model accurately predicts the AC port currents in
				a TAB converter. The model can be used to compute performance metrices of the TAB converter
				such as the peak and RMS currents at the AC ports, and the average currents at the DC ports. One
				of the features of the proposed model is that it can predict the impact of transformer magnetizing
				inductance on the AC and DC port currents. The proposed model is valid for all operating modes
				and modulation strategies of the TAB converter. The accuracy of the model has been verified against
				extensive switching circuit simulations for a variety of operating conditions. Experimental results
				from a TAB converter laboratory prototype are also presented to showcase the impact of magnetizing

			<div class="abs_authors"> Mohammed Imthias and Umanand L</div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, </div>

				A multilevel 12-sided polygonal voltage space vector generation scheme for variable-speed drive
				applications with a single DC-link operation requires an enormous capacitance value for cascaded
				H-bridge (CHB) filters when operated at lower speeds. The multilevel 12-sided polygonal structure

				proposes a new scheme to minimise the capacitance requirement for full-speed operation by

				IN last decade multilevel inverters (MLIs) have become very popular in high power applications
				namely variable speed drives, high voltage DC transmission, renewable energy and electric vehicles.
				It offers many advantages such as low harmonic distortion in voltage and current, low dv/dt across
				motor phase terminals, less bulky filter size, operation at low switching frequency etc. There are
				three popular MLI topologies - Neutral point clamp (NPC), Flying Capacitor (FC) and Cascaded
				H-Bridge (CHB) which are widely discussed in the literature. MLIs can also be realised by a dual
				inverter structure feeding an open-end winding induction motor (OEWIM) where either end of
				stator terminals are connected to two separate inverters. Among several dual inverter topologies,
				recently, the dual inverter with a single DC-link has become popular. Here the primary inverter is
				supplied by a DC link, and the secondary inverter is fed from a floating capacitor. This configuration
				aids in increasing the phase voltage levels with a reduced number of switches besides the benefit
				of reliability and fault-tolerant capability. These two inverters together can generate a combined
				hexagonal multilevel space vector structure (SVS) of radius Vdc similar to a 2-level inverter single
				hexagonal structure feeding the IM from one end using a DC-link voltage of Vdc. For any hexagonal
				SVS, the maximum peak phase fundamental voltage that can be attained from a DC link of Vdc is
				0.637Vdc (correspond to the full base speed operation of the IM drive), when the inverter operates
				in six-step mode. But the generic SVPWM mode operation can achieve a peak phase fundamental
				of 0.577Vdc in extreme linear modulation range (LMR). Here the maximum radius of the rotating
				voltage space vector (SV) is 0.866Vdc which can be inscribed within the hexagonal SVS. Further
				increasing of the modulation range above 0.577Vdc will result in all the lower order harmonics
				(predominantly 5 th , 7 th , 11th and 13th) appearing in the motor phase voltage. These harmonic
				contents cause low-frequency torque pulsations that may even break the motor shaft. Hence, these
				lower-order harmonics need to be eliminated to operate the motor seamlessly till full base speed.
				In this work, a 10-level dual inverter scheme is investigated to eliminate all the lower order
				harmonics (5 th ,7 th ,11th ,13th , etc.) while extending the LMR from 0.577Vdc to 0.637Vdc
				peak phase fundamental regardless of load power factor. The proposed inverter topology supplies
				an OEWIM where the primary side is a cascade of a 2-level inverter and HB while the secondary
				side is connected to a floating capacitor fed 2-level inverter cascaded with an HB. The proposed
				inverter structure will synthesize a hexagonal SVS of more than 9-levels. Those extra levels will be
				switched in a unique way to extend the modulation range without surpassing the maximum voltage
				SV amplitude of Vdc along A,B, C phases at any time. All the capacitors in this topology can be
				balanced simultaneously and independently using the concept of opposing vector redundancy of a
				Space Vector Point (SVP). The proposal to balance the capacitors, even at an extended modulation
				range (from 0.577Vdc to 0.637Vdc peak phase fundamental) for u.p.f load (since u.p.f is the worst
				case condition to charge balance all floating capacitors at the extreme modulation) is possible in the
				proposed scheme.

			<div class="abs_authors"> Ruman Kalyan Mahapatra and Umanand L</div>
			<div class="abs_dept">  Department of Electronic Systems Engineering</div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				This work presents a galvanically isolated single-phase inverter topology with a flux-rate control-based
				harmonic filtering scheme. The proposed topology consists of a high-power primary inverter that
				operates at low frequency and establishes the primary flux. A low-power secondary inverter that
				operates at high frequency is associated with another limb of the magnetic core, which controls the
				flux rate. The undesired harmonic components present in the primary flux are filtered by controlling
				the flux rate to provide a sinusoidal output voltage at the load. These two inverters and the load
				side of the proposed topology are associated with the three-limbed magnetic core. The load side of
				the proposed inverter topology is galvanically isolated from the rest of the circuit. That causes the
				load side of the proposed inverter to be free from any power electronics components and passive
				filters. Hence, the inverter is suitable for medium to high voltage applications without modifying the
				power semiconductor device ratings. The proposed inverter is modeled using the popular bond-graph
				modeling technique, and the dynamic equations are obtained from the model. The derived dynamic

				Six-phase Machine in Linear and Overmodulation Regions   </div>
			<div class="abs_authors"> Sayan Paul</div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of Electrical Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				This work presents two pulse-width-modulation (PWM) techniques of a two-level inverter fed
				asymmetrical six-phase machine (ASPM) to reduce the drive system’s loss and improve efficiency.
				The first PWM technique is applicable in the overmodulation region, and the second is relevant in
				the linear region.
				Overmodulation (OVM) techniques of ASPM achieve higher DC-bus utilization by applying
				voltage in the non-energy transfer plane. This results in unwanted current and associated copper
				loss. The existing OVM technique minimizes this voltage from the space-vector perspective with a
				pre-defined set of four active vectors. To find the best technique, one needs to perform the above
				minimization problem with all possible sets of active vectors with which higher voltage gain can be
				attained. So, this requires evaluation of a large number of cases. This work formulates the above
				minimization problem in terms of average voltage vectors of two three-phase inverters, where active
				vectors need not be specified beforehand. Thus, the analysis is more general. Sixteen possible
				techniques with different active vectors are derived following the above analysis, which attains
				minimum voltage injection in the non-energy transfer plane.
				Linear modulation techniques (LMTs) of an ASPM with two isolated neutral points synthesize
				the desired voltage vectors by applying at least five switching states. Different choices of applied
				voltage vectors, sequences in which they are used, distribution of dwell-times among the redundant
				switching states give rise to a large number of possible LMTs. These LMTs should avoid more
				than two transitions of a particular inverter leg within a carrier period. Only a subset of existing
				LMTs of ASPM follows this rule. This work finds a way to account for all possible infinitely many
				LMTs that follow the rule of at most two transitions per leg through an innovative approach. Another
				essential criterion for the selection of an LMT is its current-ripple performance. Therefore, through
				numerical optimization, the work finds optimal LMTs among the above infinite possible LMTs for
				all reference voltage vectors in the linear range and the whole feasible range of a machine parameter.
				This parameter is related to the leakage inductance of the machine and impacts the current ripple
				performance of ASPM. An optimal hybrid strategy is proposed with these optimal techniques, which
				outperforms all existing methods in terms of the current ripple.
				The theoretical analysis of the above two PWM techniques is validated through simulation in
				Matlab and experiments performed up to 3.5 kW on a hardware prototype.

			<div class="abs_authors">Ashiq Muhammed P E </div>
			<div class="abs_dept"> Department of High Voltage Engineering </div>
			<div class="abs_text"> 
				Accurate knowledge of the natural frequencies and shapes of corresponding standing waves are
				essential for gaining deeper insight into the nature of response of coils to impulse excitations. Most of
				the previous analytical studies on coils assumed shape of standing waves as sinusoidal but numerical
				circuit analysis and measurements suggest otherwise. Hence, this paper revisits the classical standing
				wave phenomenon in coils to ascertain reasons for this discrepancy and thereafter extends it by
				analytically deriving the exact mode shape of standing waves for both neutral open/short conditions.
				For this, the coil is modeled as a distributed network of elemental inductances and capacitances
				while spatial variation of mutual inductance between turns is described by an exponential function.
				Initially, an elegant derivation of the governing partial differential equation for surge distribution
				is presented which is then analytically solved, perhaps for the first time, by the variable-separable
				method to find the complete solution (sum of time and spatial terms). Hyperbolic terms in spatial part
				of solution have always been neglected but are included here, thus, yielding the exact mode shapes.
				Voltage standing waves gotten from analytical solution are plotted and compared with simulation
				results on a 100-section ladder network. The same is measured on a large-sized single layer coil. So,
				it emerges that, even in single layer coils, shape of standing waves deviates considerably from being
				sinusoidal and this deviation depends on spatial variation of mutual inductance, capacitive coupling,
				and order of standing waves.

			<div class="abs_text"> 
				A commercial aircraft can expect on an average one lightning strike per year i.e. one lightning strike
				in approximately 3000 hours of flight. Severity of damage due to lightning can range from minor
				burn mark, creation of holes on skin upto complete destruction of aircraft. Nowadays, use of less
				conducting composite materials for constructing structural elements of aircraft enhances possibility
				of physical damages. Increasing use of sensitive electronics components in on-board equipment of
				aircraft further makes it more vulnerable to indirect effect of lightning strike. Therefore, protection
				of aircraft against lightning is one of the major aspects of modern aircraft design.
				An aircraft can be struck by lightning in two possible ways – aircraft-initiated lightning where the
				aircraft itself incepts bi-directional leaders. Aircraft-intercepted lightning where a cloud to ground
				lightning gets intercepted by aircraft. Recorded data from in-flight measurements suggest that almost
				90% of events of lightning strike occurred due to aircraft-initiated leaders. Hence, the study will be
				limited only to aircraft-initiated lightning phenomena.
				The first step of designing of lightning protection on aircraft is Zoning where the aircraft surface
				is divided into several distinct zones depending on the probability of lighting strike. Several methods
				have been suggested in standard (ARP5414) such as Rolling Sphere Method (RSM), Similarity
				Principle, Field based approach. All these methods are either empirical or qualitative and lacks
				the physical basis of leader discharge from aircraft. For more accurate assessment of zoning, the
				discharge phenomena need to be modelled. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to develop a model
				for inception and propagation of bi-directional leader from cruising aircraft.
				This presentation highlights the salient features of leader inceptions from cruising aircraft
				followed by brief description of the model developed and demonstration of propagation of connecting
				leaders from aircraft.
