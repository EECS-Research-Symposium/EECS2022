	"abstract" : "Translational neuroimaging methods has empowered Neuroscience with a tool to investigate the inner structure and workings of the CNS. Translational MRI research provides an opportunity for developing non-invasive advanced neuroimaging methods for early and accurate detection and characterization of various neurological disorders in humans and animal models. These translational neuroimaging methods hold promise as non-invasive, quantitative parameters to assess the structural and functional brain connectivity and probe metabolic alternations and may be used as surrogate imaging biomarkers for studying various CNS disorders.",
	"bio" : "Dr. Manoj Kumar is currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neuroimaging and Interventional Radiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, since 2019. Dr. Manoj has completed his post-doctoral research training at the Laboratory of Molecular imaging, Perlman school of medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. He has a keen interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) techniques to understand the pathophysiological basis of pediatrician brain diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. His area of research is to develop non-invasive advanced MR imaging methods for early and accurate diagnosis and characterization of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in human and animal models of various pathological conditions."
