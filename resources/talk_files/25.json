	"abstract" : "Sub-threshold analog design has made  inroads into industrial class products.This is one area were winners can boast about the lowest Iq in the industry.One usually associates  designing in the subthreshold as giving up performance, or giving up robustness, and hence are perceived as best avoided for industrial designs. This talk is about the key care aboutâ€™s, pitfalls, approaches  for analog design in the  sub-threshold, while  balancing  performance and robustness.",
