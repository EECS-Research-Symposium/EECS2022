	"abstract" : "E-commerce is seeing rapid growth in India. Most of the new users who are coming onboard are non-English speaking users who may have little to no experience with consumer internet. For these users, it is a daunting task to discover the right products that they are looking for, get answers to any questions they may have about the products and complete the purchase online.

In this talk we will talk about several applications of NLP and conversational AI that have been employed to overcome these challenges and assist the users in their buying and post purchase journey.",
