	"abstract" : "Human computer interaction based on gestures forms an important and popular approach among the various other modalities. While camera-based gesture recognition is widely used, privacy restrictions and other limitations such as dependence on lighting prohibit its usage in several applications. Lately, the SONAR-based approach is gaining a lot of attention as microphones and speakers are ubiquitous. In this talk, we will describe our recent works on gesture and air writing recognition based on SONAR. Further, our economical spiked neural network-based classifier implementation shall also be briefly provided. ",
