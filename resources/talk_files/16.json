	"abstract" : " In this talk, I will first review our recent work on synthesizing image and video contents. The underlying theme is to exploit different priors to synthesize diverse content with robust formulations.  I will then present our recent work on image synthesis, video synthesis, and frame interpolation. I will also present our recent work on learning to synthesize images with limited training data. When time allows, I will also discuss some recent findings for other vision tasks.",
