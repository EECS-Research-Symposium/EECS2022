	"abstract" : "Many important modern-day applications such as autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, surveillance etc. warrant the use of Imaging radars - that offer high detection accuracy and resolution while maintaining privacy. Imaging radars need to act as more than 4-D imaging devices that not only detect range, Doppler and direction-of-arrival (in Azimuth and Elevation) with high accuracy, but also provide information on object classification, etc. Considering state-of-the-art IC, MIMO antenna array and signal processing systems that reinforce each other in bringing out high resolution imaging at optimal cost",
	"bio" : "Sai Gunaranjan Pelluri received his Master's(Research) degree from IISc, Bangalore in 2017 specializing in signal processing and joint spectro-temporal analysis. Post his Master's, he joined Texas Instruments, India as a Systems Engineer working on on-chip RADAR systems. At TI, his work primarily involved gauging the performance of RF parameters of the RADAR SoC. In 2018, he joined Steradian Semiconductors, a startup developing Radar Transceivers and complete Radar Sensor Systems for Imaging applications. In Steradian Semiconductors, he currently works as a Lead Design Engineer and is responsible for developing efficient signal processing algorithms for generating a point cloud image from RADAR measurements. He has worked on several schemes like Time Division Multiplexing, Code Division Multiplexing, High-Resolution spectral estimation algorithms to improve both accuracy and resolution aspects of various RADAR parameters such as Range, Velocity, Angle. His interests include signal processing, stochastic processes, matrix theory, and machine learning among others. He is passionate about reading."
