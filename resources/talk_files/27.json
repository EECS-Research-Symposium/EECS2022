	"abstract" : "Over the past few years, programmable networks have revolutionized networking by providing abstractions to program the control-plane and data-plane of networks. In this talk, I will be giving a brief introduction to programmable networks, and how it can be useful in designing : 1) 5G Fronthaul Slicing Architecture (FSA) which runs in the switch data plane and uses information from the wireless schedule to identify the slice of a fronthaul data packet at line-rate. It enables multipoint-to-multipoint routing as well as packet prioritization to provide multiplexing gains in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, making the system more scalable. 2) A better network debugger which enables visibility, retrospection and correlation to debug transient network issues and achieving network-level observability.Finally, I will be briefly talk about the current challenges in achieving end-to-end observability in microservices based applications which are typically deployed as containers and connected using multiple Container Network Interfaces (CNI).",
